&nbsp;***Beat the Sugar Spike***

Real-Time, Context-Aware Nudges for Healthier Choices

Live Application

 **Problem Overview**



Young individuals (ages 16–32) frequently consume sugary drinks and snacks without tracking their intake or understanding the short-term impact on their body. Existing health applications:



Require excessive data input



Focus on long-term goals like weight loss



Lack real-time behavioral nudges



Create friction during logging



This results in poor habit formation and untracked sugar consumption.



&nbsp;**Our Solution**



Beat the Sugar Spike is a lightweight, gamified web application that enables users to:



Log sugar intake in under 10 seconds



Receive instant, personalized feedback



Get one immediate corrective action



Build consistent daily habits through gamification



Use the app without mandatory signup



The system combines behavioral psychology with lightweight contextual intelligence to drive healthier choices.



&nbsp;***Core Features***

&nbsp;**1. Fast, Frictionless Logging**



One-tap sugar event capture



No long forms



Minimal interaction time (<10 seconds)



 **2. Gamified Onboarding (Signup-Free)**



Age



Height



Weight



Gender



BMI calculated silently



Onboarding is designed as a smooth, game-like experience.



 **3. Context-Aware Insight Generation**



The system analyzes:



Time of day



BMI



User profile data



Example insight:



“Late evening sugar may reduce your sleep quality.”



Insights are simple, non-diagnostic, and behavior-focused.



 **4. Personalized Corrective Action**



Each sugar event generates one actionable suggestion:



Take a 10-minute walk



Avoid sugar after 7 PM



Try a protein snack instead



Actions are immediate and achievable.



&nbsp;**5. Gamified Retention System**



Daily streak tracking



Variable XP rewards (3–7 points)



Instant feedback animations



Progress visualization
